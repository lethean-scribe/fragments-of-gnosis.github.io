# CFD Content Pipeline: Automated Publishing with GitHub Pages and Jekyll

This repository contains the setup for an automated content pipeline designed for publishing CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) related articles. The pipeline leverages GitHub Pages for hosting a Jekyll-based website and integrates with automation services like Zapier/IFTTT to automatically distribute content to platforms such as Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to streamline the process of creating and distributing CFD-related content. By writing content once in Markdown, it can be automatically published to a personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages and then syndicated to various social media and blogging platforms. This saves time and ensures consistent content delivery across multiple channels.

## Features

*   **Jekyll-based Blog**: A fast, static website generated from Markdown files.
*   **GitHub Pages Hosting**: Free and reliable hosting directly from your GitHub repository.
*   **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys your site on every push to the `main` branch.
*   **RSS Feed Generation**: Automatically generates an RSS feed (`/feed.xml`) for easy content syndication.
*   **Cross-Platform Publishing**: Instructions for setting up Zapier/IFTTT to push content to:
    *   Medium (as new stories)
    *   LinkedIn (as shared posts)
    *   Twitter (as tweets)
    *   Reddit (via notification for manual posting)
*   **MathJax & Prism.js Integration**: Support for mathematical equations and code highlighting in your posts.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your own CFD content pipeline.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

*   A GitHub account.
*   Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub.
*   Accounts on Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter (optional, but recommended for full automation).
*   An account with Zapier, IFTTT, or Make.com (for cross-platform automation).

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cfd-content-pipeline.git
    cd cfd-content-pipeline
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a new repository on GitHub and push this content to it. Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.)*

2.  **Install Ruby and Bundler:**
    Jekyll is built with Ruby. If you don't have Ruby installed, follow the instructions for your operating system. On Ubuntu, you can use:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
    ```
    Then, set up your gem environment and install Bundler:
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc # Or restart your terminal
    gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
    ```

3.  **Install Jekyll Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required gems:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

4.  **Run Jekyll Locally:**
    To preview your site locally, run:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    Your site will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. 

1.  **Create a new GitHub Repository:** Create a new public repository on GitHub named `your-username.github.io` (replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username). This is crucial for GitHub Pages to work correctly.
2.  **Push your code:** Push the contents of this `cfd-content-pipeline` directory to your new `your-username.github.io` repository.
    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
3.  **Configure GitHub Pages:** Go to your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to 


the "Pages" section, and ensure that GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch (which the GitHub Action will create and manage).

4.  **Monitor Deployment:** The `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` workflow in `.github/workflows/` will automatically build and deploy your Jekyll site whenever you push changes to the `main` branch. You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

### Cross-Platform Automation (Zapier/IFTTT)

Once your GitHub Pages site is live, you can set up automation workflows to distribute your content to other platforms. The key is to use your site's RSS feed as the trigger.

Your RSS feed will typically be located at: `https://your-username.github.io/feed.xml`

Refer to the `automation_instructions.md` file in this repository for detailed, step-by-step guides on configuring Zapier or IFTTT for Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Reddit.

### Content Creation Guide

1.  **Write in Markdown:** All your blog posts should be written in Markdown format (`.md` files).
2.  **Location:** New blog posts go into the `_posts` directory. The filename format is crucial: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`.
3.  **Front Matter:** Each post must start with YAML Front Matter, enclosed by `---` lines. This includes metadata like `title`, `date`, `categories`, `tags`, and `author`.
    ```yaml

    categories: [CFD, Tutorials]
    tags: [simulation, fluid dynamics, software]
    author: "Your Name"
    ---
    ```
4.  **Images:** Place any images for your posts in the `assets/images/` directory and reference them in your Markdown like `![Alt Text](/assets/images/your-image.png)`.
5.  **Equations:** Use MathJax for rendering mathematical equations. Enclose inline equations with `$` (e.g., `$E=mc^2$`) and block equations with `$$` (e.g., `$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0 $$`).
6.  **Code Blocks:** Use standard Markdown fenced code blocks for code highlighting.
    ````markdown
    ```python
    # Example Python code
    print("Hello CFD!")
    ```
    ````
