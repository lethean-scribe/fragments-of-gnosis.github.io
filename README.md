The Delphic Node repository hosts the official blog of the Lethean Scribe, record-keeper of oblivion. A platform dedicated to exploring and documenting various technical topics, with a particular focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). 

## Content Focus

The primary focus of the Lethean Scribe blog is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **CFD Mesh Generation:** Detailed reviews and comparisons of mesh generation software, including their capabilities, licensing, and target applications.
*   **CFD Solvers:** Discussions on various numerical methods and software used for solving fluid flow equations.
*   **Systematic Literature Reviews:** In-depth analyses of academic research and publications in the CFD domain.
*   **Technical Tutorials:** Guides and explanations on practical aspects of CFD simulations.

The content is designed to be highly informative and structured, often featuring tables and comparisons to aid understanding. The author, "Lethean Scribe," maintains a philosophical approach to these technical topics, as suggested by the blog's description: "Floating on river of forgetfulness."

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a standard Jekyll blog structure:

*   `_config.yml`: The main configuration file for the Jekyll site, defining site-wide settings, plugins, and metadata.
*   `_posts/`: Contains all the blog posts written in Markdown format. Each post includes front matter for metadata such as title, date, categories, and tags.
*   `_layouts/`: Defines the HTML templates for different page types (e.g., posts, pages).
*   `_includes/`: Stores reusable HTML snippets.
*   `_sass/` and `css/`: Contain the styling files for the blog, utilizing SCSS for modular and maintainable stylesheets.
*   `js/`: Holds JavaScript files for interactive elements or additional functionality.
*   `about.markdown`: The "About" page content.
*   `LICENSE`: The licensing information for the project (MIT License).
